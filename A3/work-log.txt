10-13-25 10:09 beginning initial setup work for A3. i have reorganized my CSC475 git repo to better keep track of files. I have copied over Matrix.class and Main.java because I want to re-use the same logic and engine made in A2. Going to research some on file i/o and efficient ways to read lots of data fast 
10-16-25 1:31pm officially beginning actual work on this. Working on a todo list for what all needs to be done
I will use the following recommended "meta parameters" and change them as needed to increase accuracy:
    eta = 3
    minibatch size m = 10 => 6000 inputs per minibatch
    30 epochs
I must now figure out the idea of what my matrices at each layer will look like. I must also research IO stuff to see what the best way to read in would be. I will likely use BufferedReader (and prob later BufferedWriter for saving weights and biases) as I have used it before in CSC325 for an assignment. The idea would then just be how do i delimit across the commas to only capture the values wanted and then i would need to convert those values back into their double representation instead of their character representation (which may present actual problems as i dont know of ASCII casting working to double)
10-16-25 1:49pm concensus I have reached is that I will assume the input layer is a 784x1 matrix. then the first weight matrix should be a 15 x 784 so that we get a 15 x 1 returned by that operation. this directly then implies that the bias layer should be a 15x1 for addition to be defined. then to get a 10x1 in final layer we should multiply this 15x1 by a 10x15 (other way around bc matrix mul not commutative) and add a 10x1 bias layer. I can now get started on reading in the file and filling matrices. After doing this, i think the next plan of action should be working through the batching process and understanding how this input is going to be processed with my preexisting logic from A2. Then filling weights and biases with random numbers. also i now see that i am misunderstanding that we will get doubles from the csv but rather we are going to get doubles by normalizing the values by dividing them all by 255
10-16-25 2:32pm implemented logic from old assignment that essentially just took each line of the file and turned it to a String and cast it to a char[]. problem with this is it will split digits that need to be together. so instead i need to find a way to literally just delimit about commas and then place values into returned matrix 
10-16-25 2:41pm changed it so that now it is splitting but the logic shared by both is actually reading the entire file. so i am now presented with two immediate solutions: return a Matrix[][] and read the entire file line by line and fill all of the inputs at one time, or change the method entirely to do something that will probably be more time consuming to think thru. i am going to go with the first route. the idea is that i will initialize a Matrix[][] of size [amount of minibatches][amount of inputs] (which i know ahead of time will be [10][6000]) and then iterate through the rows of this Matrix[] and then the columns and read the file line by line and split the numbers and fill matrices with each line, then that Matrix object will be placed at arr[i][j] and then so on and so forth
10-16-25 3:08pm logic is done for new readAndFill method. it now takes in a File object, an amount of inputs (columns in 2d array) and m which is the minibatch size. the idea is that once this is done, this is now our entire batch with minibatches inside. it compiles and the logic seems like it works despite taking a small bit to compile. had to debug an issue where i had the try block inside the inner for loop so i was literally just reopening the file over again and starting over. I was also iterating i instead of j in the j-for loop. i am now going to make a method to generate random weights and biases. the idea behind this will be i will pass in an m and an n value for the dimensions so that this can be used for both layers generation of weights and biases.

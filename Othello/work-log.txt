11-2-25 3:17pm i am just now beginning on Othello. I am going to use Java. I want to really abstract this out to make it easier to think through, so first I will be making a Piece and Board class and experiment first with just getting the game logic down. 
11-2-25 5:31pm i have a piece and board class. the piece class basically just holds a "color" which is a boolean since they are either white (true) or black (false). it has a method that "flips" it by negating the color field. the Board class has a board field that is a 2D piece array. how i want to structure the logic of this is to use a CLI with a chess board structure (something like A3, where A-H are columns, 1-8 are the rows). this allows for really basic indexing and we can just do conversion math. going to start on game logic now. i also googled how to clear a screen without a bunch of println calls (w reference)
11-2-25 6:47 before i begin on this, i need to have a way to check if a move is legal before its possible. gonna make a method that just checks every possible violation with conditionals. i believe it should be as simple as passing the coordinates we wanna place a Piece at and then checking all around to see if its possible to maintain the rules of the game

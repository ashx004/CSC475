Repository for my assignment submissions for FALL 2025 CSC4753 Artificial Intelligence at Louisiana Tech University. 
A2 trains a small neural 4-3-2 3 layer neural network using provided initial weights and biases, and uses gradient descent and backpropagation to correct error. This is performed across 6 epochs of the full data set. 
A3 uses the training engine developed in A2 to process the MNIST dataset. A3 classifies images, and has many different modes that the user can select upon the model training across the data.
